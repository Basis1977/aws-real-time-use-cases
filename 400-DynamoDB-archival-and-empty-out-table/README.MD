# DynamoDB Database archival and empty table

## Scenario
Testing is in progress and 50 lakh records have been pushed into one DynamoDB database. After this initial day load has completed regular testing needs to continue. This huge amount of data is causing delay in day to day scans and queries.
Customer has asked us to archive the initial load of 50 lakh records and empty out the table. The archived data should be easily available to be inserted back into the table if required.
