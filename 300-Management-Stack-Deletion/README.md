What is your recommendation?

## üéØ Solutions

Unfortunately it is not possible to restore the deleted stack, Instead you can recreate the resources in the stack with the same template and copy the data from backups. To avoid or mitigate the impact of accidental deletion you can use the following options,

1. Set _DeletionPolicy_ Attribute in Clouformation
1. Restrict the ability of users to _delete_ or _update_ a stack and its resources at IAM
1. Assign a _stack policy_ to prevent updates to stack resources
1. Enable _Termination protection_
