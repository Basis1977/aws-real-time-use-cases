# Automate Start/Stop of GPU Instances

## 🔥 Scenario

Your customer is running GPU workload on some very expesive AWS machines. They have purchased `3` application licenses, that allows to run a maximum of `3` machines at any given time, that also  means only 3 developers can run their jobs/work at any time.

To keep costs down, your customer wants to turn off the machines when no one is using them. The developers need the flexibility to start the machines any time they want.

You are tasked to provided a simple solution, that will,

- Power `OFF` the machines when they are not in use.

- Allow developers to power `ON` / `OFF` the machines. _Remember the application developers dont have access AWS Console, nor are they interested in learning to use the AWS console_

- Ensure the maximum number of machines that can run is `3` at any given time.
