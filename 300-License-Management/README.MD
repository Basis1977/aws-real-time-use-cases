## Scenario

Your customer is running a application(based on a COTS product). They run this application only when needed by the businesss users and turn them off when not in use.
The COTS product uses a licensing model that ties to the number of machines running its software. Your customer wants to reduce wastage of licenses allocated to the terminated machine.
