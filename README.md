### Generic Guidance

  A very broad guidance on the `difficulty level` on the topics. These are not written on stone, more like lines on shifting sands, can be very subjective depending upon the audience and the ecosystem.

- `100`: Introductory and overview.
- `200`: Intermediate level, requires specific details about the topic.
- `300`: Advanced level, requires in-depth understanding of features.
- `400`: Expert level; requires expert-to-expert interaction & coverage of specialized deep-dives into specific topics.
- `500`: Thought Leadership
- Anything more than should be _Zen Mode_ or _God Mode_ what do you say?
